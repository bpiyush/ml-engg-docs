### How to get started with `just-the-docs` theme?

1. Create a new public repo with a `README.md`.
2. In the repo, go to `Settings -> Pages` and enable Github Pages. ([reference](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/))
3. Add a new file `_config.yml` and add the following line to it:
    ```yaml
    remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
    ```

    That's it! You have the template ready.
